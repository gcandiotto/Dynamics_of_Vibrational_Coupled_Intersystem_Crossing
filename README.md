# Inputs and Molecular structure for *Dynamics of Vibrational Coupled Intersystem Crossing  in State-of-the-Art Organic Optoelectronic Materials*
This repository contains the inputs and molecular structures used in the project Dynamics of Vibrational Coupled Intersystem Crossing in State-of-the-Art Organic Optoelectronic Materials.

HSO: contains the input files for the calculation of spin-orbit coupling of the molecules in groups I, II, III, and IV. These geometries were taken from the Reorganization_Energy_and_Singlet_Triplet_Energies folder, following the scheme in Figure 2 of the article.

HSO_and_NTO_frozen_scan_Y6_and_IT4Cl: contains the input files for the Y6 and IT-4Cl molecules with geometries where the dihedral angle (fixed) is rotated to 90°, 110°, and 140°.

IT4Cl_frozen_scan: contains the input files for the IT-4Cl molecule for fixed angles of 60°, 70°, 90°, 100°, 130°, 150°, 160°, and 170°, in the geometry of the first singlet excited state.

NTO: contains the input files for the Natural Transition Orbitals of the molecules in groups I, II, III, and IV. These geometries were taken from the Reorganization_Energy_and_Singlet_Triplet_Energies folder, following the scheme in Figure 2 of the article.

Relaxed_Scan_S1_IT4Cl: contains the input files for the relaxed scan from 0° to 180° for the IT-4Cl molecule.

Relaxed_Scan_S1_Y6: contains the input files for the relaxed scan from 0° to 180° for the Y6 molecule.

Reorganization_Energy_and_Singlet_Triplet_Energies: contains the input files for the calculation of the reorganization energy from the singlet state to the triplet state for the molecules in groups I, II, III, and IV.

Y6_frozen_scan: contains the input files for the Y6 and IT-4Cl molecules with geometries where the dihedral angle is rotated to 60°, 65°, 70°, 90°, 110°, 120°, 140°, 150°, and 160°, in the geometry of the first singlet excited state.
